# API Configuration Fix - Summary

## Problem
The application was making API calls to `localhost` instead of the production domain `innomatics.bdotsoftware.com`, causing login and other API requests to fail when accessed from the live website.

## Root Cause
- Hardcoded `localhost` URLs in the JavaScript files
- Relative API paths that resolved to localhost when accessed from the production domain

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Configuration File (`js/config.js`)
- Centralized configuration for all API endpoints
- Automatic environment detection (development vs production)
- Production URLs point to `https://innomatics.bdotsoftware.com`
- Development mode auto-detection for localhost environments

### 2. Updated JavaScript Files
- **admin.html**: Updated login authentication API calls
- **admin-dashboard.js**: Updated all API endpoints (auth, subjects, recordings)
- **script.js**: Updated recordings API calls and debug configuration
- **index.html**: Added configuration script reference

### 3. Environment Auto-Detection
The configuration automatically detects the environment:
- **Production**: Uses `https://innomatics.bdotsoftware.com` URLs
- **Development**: Uses `localhost` URLs when accessed locally

## Files Modified
1. `/js/config.js` (created)
2. `/admin.html`
3. `/admin-dashboard.js`
4. `/admin-dashboard.html`
5. `/script.js`
6. `/index.html`
7. `/test-config.html` (created for testing)

## API Endpoints Now Configured
- Auth: `https://innomatics.bdotsoftware.com/api/auth.php`
- Subjects: `https://innomatics.bdotsoftware.com/api/subjects.php`
- Recordings: `https://innomatics.bdotsoftware.com/api/recordings.php`

## Testing
1. Visit `https://innomatics.bdotsoftware.com/test-config.html` to verify configuration
2. Test login functionality at `https://innomatics.bdotsoftware.com/admin.html`
3. Verify all API calls in browser developer tools now point to the correct domain

## Benefits
- ✅ No more localhost API call errors
- ✅ Centralized configuration management
- ✅ Automatic environment detection
- ✅ Easy to maintain and update
- ✅ Works in both development and production

The fix ensures that all API calls will now be made to the correct production domain when accessing the website from `https://innomatics.bdotsoftware.com`.
