### **Step 3: Test API Key Management**
1. Click the ⚙️ **Settings** option in the left sidebar
2. You should see the "Dashboard Settings" page with:
   - **API Configuration** card on the left
   - **Notification Settings** card on the right

## 🔧 Alternative Testing Method

If the main dashboard has issues, use the test page:

```
Open: test-features.html in your browser
```

This isolated test page allows you to:
- Test API key saving/loading
- Test API connection
- Test notification system
- Open the main dashboard

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **If Settings Page Doesn't Appear:**
- Make sure you're clicking the ⚙️ Settings link in the sidebar
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### **If Notifications Don't Work:**
- Check if the 🔔 bell icon is visible in the header
- Open browser console and look for "NotificationManager" messages
- Try the test-features.html page first

### **If API Key Fields Don't Appear:**
- The fields should be in Settings → API Configuration card
- Try refreshing the page
- Check if JavaScript files are loading properly
